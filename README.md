# BankApplication
A mock banking app that allows users to create their own personal accounts with a username and password. 
The users can then open a checking or savings account that can be deposited to or withdrawn from.
Users can also create administrator accounts. Administrator users can create, read, update, or delete any and all accounts, and can also pull up the information of any account.
All the information is saved to a SQL database suing JDBC and phpMyAdmin.
The GUI for the app is made with Swing.
